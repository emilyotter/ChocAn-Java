    <h1>Individual Project Requirements</h1>
        <p>
            Chocoholics Anonymous “ChocAn” is a rehabilitation program for people who are addicted to chocolate.
            Members pay a fee to ChocAn and are then able to use in-network providers for free.
            These providers use a custom software stack written by our team to authenticate members and track their service. Our software system will 
            aid the organization with records 
            and communication among members, providers, operators, and third-party systems.
            Five programmers were assigned to work on this project.
            Our team collectively spent time analyzing the Chocoholics Anonymous project document.
            We independently identified use cases, and then decided as a group which ones to include.
            Along with this, we specified the actors and their interactions with the use cases.
            The use case descriptions are written to clarify further interactions among these elements.
            The descriptions also go into detail regarding the steps for each use case and how the software product being created will handle each scenario.
            We assumed each actor would have access to a terminal in which they could log in with separate authentications to view their specialized menu.
            After writing the descriptions for the use cases,
            we scanned them for any words that would not be understood from an outside perspective,
            assuming no previous experience with Chocoholics Anonymous or its related software.
            Each member of the group was responsible for writing their assigned use case descriptions and individual reports.
            The remaining tasks in this project were worked on by the entire group. As mentioned before,
            each team member has their own use case diagram. Each of these is embedded in its own FirstLastTeam12Report.html file.
            All the images are included in the UMLDiagrams_PNG directory.
            The team's use case diagram is embedded in this file: report.html.
            This diagram can also be found under the UMLDiagrams_PNG directory, and it is named Team12UML.png.
            Please note that the user matherdm472 is Dylan Mather and the user Xoddam is Maddox Guthrie in the bitbucket commit images.
            The submitter for this project is Maddox Guthrie.
            We used CSS and HTML for this report and will use Java in the future to implement the planned project.
