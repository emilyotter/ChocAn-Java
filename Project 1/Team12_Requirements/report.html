    <h1>Individual Project Requirements</h1>
        <p>
            In project one we were tasked with creating a use case diagram,
            descriptions for each use case, and a glossary of some key terms.
            For the use case diagram, our team each created their own diagram,
            then we all came together and used the best elements for each of
            ours to construct the one you will find in this report. For the
            use case description part of the project, the use cases were written
            in a Google document, reviewed, and then added to the report file.
            Each description was designed to accurately describe what the use case does,
            and how it would function. The glossary section of the project consists of
            key terms that are used repeatedly throughout the project and this report.
            As mentioned before, each team member has their own use case diagram.
            Each of these is embedded in its own FirstLastTeam12Report.html file.
            All of the images are named in the format of FirstLastUML.png and
            are included in the UMLDiagrams_PNG directory. The team's use case diagram
            is embedded in this file: report.html. This diagram can also be found under
            the UMLDiagrams_PNG directory, and it is named Team12UML.png. The submitter
            for the reports.html file is Maddox Guthrie.
