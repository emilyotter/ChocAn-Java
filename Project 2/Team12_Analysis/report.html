    <h1>System Requirements:</h1>
    <!--Paragraph of what is needed for the system to operate including:
    1. what sections will be computerized and how
    2. where the data will be stored
    3. what hardware will be needed
    4. how the ChocAn system you developed will interact with other systems
    5. how users will interact with the system-->
    The Chocoholics Anonymous system will include computerized components for the processes 
    of information transfer, information storage, and report generation. Data will be stored 
    in files on a cloud server so that all users can access them. Hardware needed to run this 
    system will included terminals for each user and card readers for the providers. The ChocAn 
    system will interact with a few other systems. First, it will need to be able to communicate 
    with Acme Accounting Services to handle accounting procedures and payments. The system will 
    also work with the Chocoholics Anonymous Data Center to verify members and retrieve information. 
    Finally, it will need to transmit data to the banking system in order to credit providers with 
    the correct payments. Users will interact with the system through terminals connected to the 
    main database. After verification, users will have access to a specialized menu depending on 
    their classification as provider, manager, or operator.
